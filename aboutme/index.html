    <h2>Kyle Galbraith</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kyle Galbraith and I am currently a junior attending BYU-Idaho online. I was attending in-person for the last 4 years but due to some extenuating circumstances I had to switch to online. I am from small town Hamilton, Missouri which is just an hour North East of Kansas City. It's 15 minutes from Far West Temple Site and 30 minutes from Adam Ondi Ahman. I was sealed to my beautiful wife this summer on Pioneer Day (July 24th) in the Nauvoo Illinois temple! With the struggles of life recently I have been very nostalgic, remembering the innocent days of my youth, and have gotten back into Pokemon card collecting, which with today's scalpers has become a very expensive hobby. I love spending time with my wife outside of working 40 hours a week at Verizon here in Idaho Falls and school. I love going on walks around the greenbelt and riding electric scooters around town at night. I especially love sitting outside on my balcony in my hammock reading. </p>
