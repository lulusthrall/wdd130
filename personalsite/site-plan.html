        <strong>Welcome to the TCG Vault! </strong>
        Welcome to the Poekmon TCG Vault! This site is a personal project showcasing my collection of Pokémon cards, their condition, and their current TCGplayer market value. It was built using HTML and CSS to blend a passion for collecting with new web development skills. Feel free to browse the gallery to see the full collection!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Collector and Coder (About Me)</strong><br>
        You've probably seen the "Code Cat" logo inspired by my ragdoll kitty Lulu, and that's pretty much me. My name is Kyle, and by day, I'm a developer-in-training, learning how to build clean and functional websites just like this one. By night (and on weekends), I'm an avid TCG collector, carefully sleeving cards and tracking their value. This website is the place where those two worlds collide. It's built from scratch with HTML and CSS, and every card you see is from my own personal collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What You'll Find Inside</strong><br>
        This site is split into two main sections to help you find what you're looking for. First is <strong>The Collection Gallery</strong>, which is the main visual showcase of my featured cards. You can browse the gallery and click on any card to see a high-resolution image and its specific details. The second section is the <strong>Valuation Guide</strong>, which is a beginner's introduction to how card values are determined. It explains what TCGplayer is, how to grade a card's condition, and how you can start to value your own collection.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>A Note on this Project's Purpose</strong><br>
      As this is a class project, its primary goal is to demonstrate practical web development skills. The site is built as a static website, meaning all the content is written directly into the HTML and styled with CSS, following the principles of responsive design. The card values listed are manually researched and entered, referencing the TCGplayer market price to provide a real-world, practical application for the data. This project is a testament to the power of using personal passions to fuel and motivate learning new technical skills.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Collection Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>The Main Gallery Showcase</strong><br>
        This gallery features all the cards in my featured collection. Each card image links to a detailed page with more information, including its set, rarity, condition, and current TCGplayer market value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A Focus on the Classics: Base Set and Beyond</strong><br>
        You'll notice a heavy focus on cards from the original Pokémon TCG "Base Set," as well as the "Jungle" and "Fossil" expansions. These are the cards that started it all and hold a massive amount of nostalgia for collectors like me. These sets defined the game and feature the iconic artwork from artists like Ken Sugimori that many of us grew up with. Showcasing these cards is a tribute to the start of a hobby that has lasted for over two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Read a Pokemon Card</strong><br>
        If you're new to collecting, all the symbols and text can be confusing. The most important things to look for are the card's name (at the top), its HP (in the top right), and its rarity (in the bottom right corner). The rarity symbol tells you how common the card is: a <strong>circle</strong> means common, a <strong>diamond</strong> means uncommon, and a <strong>star</strong> means rare. A star with a "holo" (shiny) image is a "Holo Rare" and is often the most valuable card in a set.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why This Isn't Just a Database</strong><br>
        You can find massive databases of every Pokémon card ever made all over the web. This site is different. It's not a complete encyclopedia; it's a *personal collection*. Each card here is one I own, have inspected, and have a story for. This personal touch is what I, as a collector, love to see from other hobbyists. It's a way to share the joy of the hobby in a curated and tangible way, rather than just scrolling through an endless, impersonal list.

      <h3>Valuation Guide</h3>
      <p>
       <strong>What is TCPplayer and Why Does It Matter?</strong><br>
       When you start to research the value of your Pokemon cards, you will immediately hear one name: TCGplayer. TCGplayer.com is a massive online marketplace that connects thousands of individual hobby stores and sellers with buyers. Because it processes such a huge volume of sales, it has become the industry standard for tracking the real-time value of cards. The "Market Price" you see listed on their site isn't just a random number; it's an average of what that card has *actually sold for* recently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How "Market Price" is Determined</strong><br>
        The TCGplayer Market Price is the most reliable metric for a card's value. It's a data-driven number based on completed sales. This is crucial because a seller can *ask* any price they want for a card, but the market price tells you what people are *actually paying*. This is why you'll see the TCGplayer Market Price referenced on each of my card detail pages—it provides a neutral, data-backed baseline for that card's value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Condition is Everything: A Simple Grading Guide</strong><br>
        A "Base Set Charizard" isn't just a "Base Set Charizard." Its value can range from $20 to $20,000 based on one thing: <strong>condition</strong>. A tiny scratch, a bit of whitening on the edges, or a small crease can change the value dramatically. Collectors use a simple scale:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Near Mint (NM):</strong>A nearly perfect card. May have a tiny speck of white on an edge, but otherwise looks like it just came out of the pack.</li>
          <li><strong>Lightly Played (LP):</strong>Has minor wear, like small scuffs or light whitening on the corners and edges. No major scratches or bends.</li>
          <li><strong>Heavily Played (HP) / Damaged (DMG):</strong>Has obvious wear, such as deep scratches, creases, bends, or water damage. These cards are worth a fraction of their Near Mint counterparts.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How to Use This Site's Data</strong><br>
        On each individual card's detail page, you will see two key pieces of information: my personal assessment of its condition (e.g., "Condition: Lightly Played") and the TCGplayer Market Price *for that specific condition*. This gives you a realistic snapshot of what my card is worth. This process of identifying, grading, and valuing is the exact same process you can use for your own cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A Quick Guide to Valuing Your Own Collection</strong><br>
        Want to know what your old collection is worth? Follow these simple steps.
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Identify the Card:</strong> Find the name and the set symbol (a small icon, usually in the bottom right).</li>
          <li><strong>Assess the Condition:</strong> Be honest! Look at the card under a bright light. Check the corners, edges, and front/back surfaces for any wear. Compare it to the grading guide above.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the Price:</strong> Go to TCGplayer.com and search for your card. Make sure to filter the results to match the condition you identified. The "Market Price" will give you a great starting point for its value.</li>
        </ol>
